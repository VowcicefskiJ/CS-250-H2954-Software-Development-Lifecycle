# CS-250-H2954-Software-Development-Lifecycle


Looking back at how I've learned to understand what users need and put that into the programs I make, I've realized it's been a big learning journey. At first, I thought programming was all about making cool stuff, but I soon found out it's more important to make things that are really useful. The main thing I learned is to talk to the users, find out what problems they face every day, and figure out what they really need from the software. This new way of thinking was a big change for me.

Using user stories has really helped me out. They let me take big, complicated problems and break them down into smaller, easier parts. Writing these stories from the point of view of the user has taught me to focus on what they actually need, not just what I think they should need. This way of doing things has made my work more about the user and more satisfying for me.

My way of making programs has changed a lot too. I used to think programming was just sitting alone and coding for a long time. But now, I see it's more about making something, getting feedback, and then making changes based on that feedback. I've started to really like agile methods, especially sprints, which are like short periods of focused work that help me keep on track. Regular quick meetings, called stand-ups, have been super helpful too. They keep everyone updated and help us solve problems quickly. I'm still learning about Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), but I can tell it's going to be great for making development smoother and faster.

Being part of a software development team has taught me a lot. I've learned that it's super important to communicate well. This means not just talking but also asking good questions and really listening to what others say. Being reliable is important too. I try to be someone my team can rely on, someone who meets deadlines and takes responsibility for their work. In tech, things change fast, so being able to adapt is essential. I've learned to be open to new ideas and changes, whether they're about the latest tech or what the project needs. Also, in this field that's always changing, I've found it's important to keep learning, both from successes and mistakes.
