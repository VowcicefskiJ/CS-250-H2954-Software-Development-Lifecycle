**Interpreting User Needs in Programming**

**How I Understand User Needs and Use User Stories**

In our SNHU Travel project, figuring out what users really needed was a big part of what we did. Working with Christy, our Product Owner, was awesome because she really got what users wanted and knew how to put that first. We used "user stories" a lot, and they were super helpful. They made sure we weren't just coding in the dark but actually making stuff that people would find useful and fun to use. For example, when we worked on the Top Five Destination feature and the Wellness Retreats SlideShow, these stories made sure we stayed on track with what users would like.


**My Approach to Developing Programs**

**Agile Processes I Want to Use More**

I've really taken to the Agile way of doing things, especially after working on this project. It was super handy when we had to add the SlideShow feature out of the blue. Looking ahead, I definitely want to keep using Agile stuff like doing things in small steps (iterative development), constantly testing and fixing things (continuous integration), and always thinking about how we can do better (feedback loops). Being the Scrum Master showed me it's not just about following a set of rules but making them work for your team and your project.

**Being Part of a Software Development Team**

**What It Means to Me**

Being a good team member in software development is about more than just coding. It's about how you work with others. Our team was pretty diverse, which was great. Christy was all about adapting to new ideas, Brian was our go-to guy for making sure everything worked right, and Nicky could code like a wizard. My job as Scrum Master was to keep everyone talking and on the same page, and to make sure we all felt like we were part of something important. I learned that being a good team member means listening, sharing what you know, respecting different ideas, and helping to create a place where everyone can do their best work.
